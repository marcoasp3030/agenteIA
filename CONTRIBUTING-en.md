# Contributing

[Português (Brasil)](CONTRIBUTING.md) · **English**


Thank you for your interest in contributing to **SistemBR**! Bug reports, fixes, tests and documentation are all welcome.

## How this repository works

This repository is generated from an internal master monorepo, the source of the Free edition (open-source, Apache 2.0), the Pro edition (commercial) and every other distribution artifact. The mirroring shows up in the history as `Sync free (agents@<sha>)` commits by `fazer-ai-bot`.

This changes little for contributors, but it explains two things:

- **Your PR is accepted here, in the public repository.** After the merge, the change is reintegrated into the master with **your authorship preserved**, and the next mirror sync regenerates the tree with it already in place. Your commit stays in this repository's history.
- **Not every master file exists here.** Pro edition features are removed during derivation (or become stubs that return 403, behind a `ProGate` in the UI). PRs rebuilding Pro functionality are not accepted; beyond that, the entire Free surface is real code, open to contribution.

## Issues

- Search existing issues (open and closed) before filing a new one.
- For bugs, include: reproduction steps, expected behavior, observed behavior and relevant logs. Use the [SistemBR issue tracker](https://github.com/marcoasp3030/agenteIA/issues).
- **Security vulnerabilities do not go in public issues:** use the private channel defined by the repository maintainer.

## Pull requests

1. For large changes, open an issue first to align on the approach and avoid rework.
2. Prefer small, focused PRs: one logical change per PR.
3. **Tests accompany fixes and features.** Ideally tests that fail without the change and pass with it, proving they pin the behavior.
4. Run `bun check` before submitting (lint, type-check, i18n and tests, the same things CI runs).
5. Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`fix(scope): ...`, `feat(scope): ...`).
6. UI copy goes through i18n (`bun i18n:extract`, keys in pt-BR and en); see [`docs/i18n.md`](docs/i18n.md).

## Development setup

The step-by-step lives in the [README](README-en.md#local-development). In short:

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env      # DATABASE_URL, MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL, ENCRYPTION_KEY
docker compose up -d      # PostgreSQL (pgvector)
bun db:bootstrap          # runtime role + grants
bun prisma:migrate
bun dev                   # http://localhost:3000
```

Per-subsystem guides live in [`docs/`](docs/); read the one for the subsystem you are touching.

## Code style

- Biome formats and lints (`bun lint`, `bun format`): 2 spaces, LF.
- Strict TypeScript; the `@/` alias points to `src/`.
- Comments only when strictly necessary, never redundant ones.

## CLA (Contributor License Agreement)

The project is distributed in two editions generated from the same master: Free (Apache 2.0) and Pro (commercial). So that your contribution can be reintegrated into the master and shipped in both, we ask for your agreement to the [CLA](CLA.md), a license grant that authorizes that use **without transferring ownership**: the code remains yours.

**By submitting a pull request you state that you have read and agree to the [CLA](CLA.md)** for that contribution and future ones.
